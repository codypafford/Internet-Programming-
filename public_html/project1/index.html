    <h2>About me</h2>
</div>
<p> &#160; &#160; Hello, my name is Cody Pafford and I am currently a senior studying computer science. I am also a
    software development intern for the company <a class="hover"
                                                   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMT_(media_corporation)"
                                                   target="_blank"> SportsMedia Technology</a> . Currently, I am
    responsible for creating applications that are used in international tennis tournaments. I just finished my first
    project for the company which was for the NCAA. I am extremely excited to graduate and get into the real world of
    programming. <br><br>
    &#160; &#160; My internship has really opened my eyes as to what I should expect as an entry level software
    developer. I have come to realize that I want to be a part of something big. I am not the kind of person who is
    likely to settle down in life and for that reason, I think I will constantly be moving. I am happy to have found a
    major that I enjoy; prior to three years ago, I had never even seen what code looks like, but now it is my passion.

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests </h2>
</div>
<p> &#160; &#160; Some of my hobbies include anything related to computer science and being outside. I like doing
    anything outdoorsy like kayaking, biking, running, and walking my dog. One of my favorite things to do in my
    freetime is go fishing or go to the zoo when the weather cooperates. My biggest interest however is traveling. I
    want to travel everywhere I can, while I can and that is something I feel very passionate about as well. Everytime I
    travel somewhere new, I have come to realize how much is out there in the world that we might be missing out on.
    <br><br>
    &#160; &#160; This summer, my girlfriend and I are planning trips to Sarasota, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia. I love
    the beautiful beaches and crystal clear water in Sarasota but am most excited about Atlanta because I am eager to
    visit the record-breaking Georgia Aquarium, which is the largest in the world. I have a pet <a class="hover"

        Axolotl </a> named Gargamel, and he is the reason why I love aquariums and exotic animals so much. If you didn't

    <h2> Education </h2>
</div>
<p> &#160; &#160; I plan to graduate from the <a class="hover"

                                                 target="_blank"> University of North Florida</a> with a bachelor's
    degree in computer science in the spring of 2020. I graduated from Mandarin High School in 2013 and attended the
    Florida State College of Jacksonville (FSCJ) for one year before moving to Tallahassee to attend Tallahassee
    Community College (TCC) for my last year before my Associate of Arts.
    <br><br> &#160; &#160;I recieved my Associate of Arts degree from FSCJ while I was still a psychology major, which
    was the first major I picked in college. After talking to a classmate in one of my prerequisite classes, he
    recommended that computer science may be a good major for me because I like problem solving. I had never heard of CS
    before that moment, but I took a leap of faith and changed my major the very next day and I haven't looked back
    since.</p>
